\begin{abstract}

Modern computers use clever tricks to increase performance without incurring
massive financial costs. One such performance improvement is seen in
hierarchical memory where a series of progressively slower memory devices work
together to reduce the latency induced by memory operations. Although these
systems work well when used effectively, naive code can break the system,
resulting in bad performance. These issues become highly apparent when looping
over large matrices. Depending on the architecture of the cache, the ordering
of the matrix in memory, and the code itself, initializing and performing
actions on matrices could take a large amount of time. This paper explores the
effects of cache on matrix operations using C-code. The results show that
programmers need pay close attention to the design of their code to ensure
proper utilization of the underlying hardware through novel means.

# Introduction

## Hierarchical Memory

_Hierarchical (Cache) memory_ utilizes a sequence of memory devices and
heuristics to improve performance of memory operations. This sequence exists to
balance performance and cost, allowing machines to take advantage of more
expensive, but faster, memory devices. The machine can then leverage these
devices for recurring or frequently used data to reduce latency.

### Locality

In order to best utilize this hierarchy of devices, engineers employ two
similar, but distinct heuristics based on _locality_. _Temporal locality_
states that data used recently is likely to be used again soon. Without
temporal locality, cache hits would rarely occur as new data from memory would
always be needed. _Spatial locality_ is the principle that data near recently
used data is likely to be needed soon. This principle drives engineers to copy
surrounding data to cache when a cache miss occurs for a memory address.



# Methodology

## Matrices

Matrices in C are stored in memory in row-major order. As such, they flatten
out in memory as a sequential vector of rows. The most efficient way of
_iteratively_ traversing this matrix is sequentially iterating over each cell
in each row in the vector. This is know as _row-wise_ traversal. By properly
utilizing spatial locality, it performs better than _column-wise_ traversal.
With large matrices, column-wise traversal will generate more cache misses as
the algorithm wont portray the same degree of spatial locality. This is because
each cell in a different row is a full matrix length of data types away from
that cell in memory.

## Recursive Initialization

In order to speed up initialization, the base matrices are encoded as
piecewise functions based on the recursive series in the lower triangular
matrix in each. This allows the matrices to initialize out of order as the
incremental operator is no longer necessary. This encoding allows for a
recursive divide-and-conquer initialization function. This function cuts the
matrix into smaller sub-matrices and initializes them one at a time. Using a
base case of an appropriately small matrix, the algorithm becomes "cache
naive". This means that it effectively uses the cache line without hardware
specific blocking. Such a solution is more general than a blocking solution
designed for a specific chipset.

### Parallel Initializtion

The recursive algorithm lends itself well to parallelism as there is no need to
lock for data access. The tux machines feature 8 physical cores that allow 16
contiguous threads. Each core has its own L1 and L2 cache, but share an L3
cache. As such, parallelism allows the software to better utilize the entirety
of the cache on the machine. Because the machines are shared, the OS will have
to schedule the processes across multiple users. As such, the program may run
better on sequential runs as more resources are allocated by the OS for the
single user account.

## Transpose

The transpose operator, $M^T$, flips each value $v_{i,j}$ in a 2D matrix $M$ by
its $i$ and $j$ values. Many novel solutions exist to speed up the transpose
operation. The fastest solution has a time complexity of $O(1)$. Instead of
directly computing the transpose, the index can simply be inverted:
$i \leftarrow j, j \leftarrow i$.
This allows access to the transposed matrix with no change in memory. By
inverting the index, this solution also inverts the optimal way to traverse the
matrix from row-wise to column-wise. This makes optimizing cache usage of
matrix operations more difficult for the programmer as the convention will
switch from row-wise to column-wise in certain states.

## Recursive Transpose

A recursive transpose operator divides a matrix into four even submatrices and
computes their transpose. The bottom-left and top-right quadrants are then
swapped. An alternative recursive solution performs the standard tranpose, but
in a divide-and-conquer fashion. This latter solution allows effective cache
line usage without additional swap operations or complex indexing.

### Parallel Transpose

Much like the recursive intialization, the tranpose operation is also easily
paralellized. This again allows for _more_ cache and CPUs operating on the
memory.

## Results

With all improvements in place, the algorithm achieves a mean score of
$\approx 4s$ using row-major ordering to initialize and transpose. Fig.
\ref{means} displays the mean times as it changes across the 5 trials of 7
experiments. The times vary slightly between sequential executions of the
program as the OS allocates resources for the users.

Fig. \ref{all-means} shows the trend of mean across all tests in the 5 trials.
Each trial demonstrates a gradual decrease in time with each additional test.
This attributes to cache hits as the same memory is accessed by the same
program during the same execution.

### Compiler Optimizations

The GCC documentation reveals compiler flags for enabling compile-time
optimizations. They offer a leveled system: `-O1`, `-O2`, and `-O3` that
sequentially enable more features. A final extreme option `-Ofast` enables
some addtional features relating to math and Fortran. The `-Ofast` flag
produces the best improvement from the base results. Fig. \ref{means-Ofast}
shows the means for the 5 trials of both row-wise and column-wise
initialization and then transposition. The compile-time optimizations reduce
both times by $\approx \frac{1}{2}$. Interestingly, column-wise operation
outperforms row-wise across the board by $\approx 200ms$.

# Conclusions

This paper presents a recursive and parallel method to initialize and transpose
a large square matrix in minimal time. A key feature of this recursive
algorithm is a natural "cache naive" trait that allows it to exploit the cache
line without explicit cache blocking. This coupled with a highly parallel
architecture, like the 16-core Intel Xeon processors in the Tux machines,
allows the algorithm to initialize and transpose a 40000x40000 matrix
($\approx 12.8$GB) in 1.9 seconds ($\approx 6.7GB/s$). Although this time is
fast, faster times certainly exist. Future research may investigate the
integration of vector architectures like GPUs to speedup the initialization and
transpose of matrices.
